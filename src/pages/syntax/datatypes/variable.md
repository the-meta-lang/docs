# Variable

A variable is a named storage location in a computer program that can hold a value. It is used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in a program. The syntax for writing a variable consists of the name of the variable, followed by an equals sign, and then the type of data the variable will contain (such as an integer, string, or boolean).

```
:VARIABLE_NAME = .TYPE
```

Variables are used to store data that can be used throughout the program, allowing for easier manipulation and organization of code.
